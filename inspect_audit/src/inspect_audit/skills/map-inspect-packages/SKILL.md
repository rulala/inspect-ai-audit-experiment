# Inspect AI Ecosystem

Inspect AI is an open-source Python framework for LLM evaluations. The core (`inspect_ai`) was originally developed by the UK AI Security Institute (AISI) and is now primarily maintained by Meridian Labs. `inspect_evals` is co-maintained by AISI and outside contributors; the remaining ecosystem packages (Flow, Scout, Viz, SWE, Harbor) are maintained by Meridian Labs. Each package owns a distinct concern. Pick the right one before writing code; fetch the package's `llms.txt` (or docs root) before calling its API or writing more than a few lines against it.

**Defer to a more specific skill if one exists.** If another installed skill's description more specifically matches the request (e.g. one dedicated to log reading, log mutation, eval writing, etc.), use that one. This skill covers ecosystem routing only.

| Package | Owns | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| **Inspect AI** | Core eval framework: `Task` / `Solver` / `Scorer` / datasets / models and providers / agents / tools / sandbox API / log and analysis APIs (`inspect_ai.log`, `inspect_ai.analysis`) / eval runners (`eval()`, `eval_set()`). | https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/llms.txt |
| **Inspect Evals** | Community catalog of 130+ pre-built benchmark evals (GAIA, SWE-Bench, Cybench, MMLU, GPQA, …). Use these before writing your own. | https://ukgovernmentbeis.github.io/inspect_evals/llms.txt |
| **Inspect Flow** | Declarative workflow orchestration: run many tasks × models × params at scale, with sweeps, defaults, and post-eval steps (`FlowSpec`, `FlowTask`). | https://meridianlabs-ai.github.io/inspect_flow/llms.txt |
| **Inspect Scout** | In-depth analysis of AI agent transcripts via LLM, grep/pattern, or multi-agent scanners. Detects issues like refusals, misconfiguration, or evaluation awareness. Imports natively from Inspect logs, plus Arize Phoenix, LangSmith, Logfire, MLFlow, W&B Weave, Claude Code sessions, and arbitrary Arrow/Parquet/custom Python sources. | https://meridianlabs-ai.github.io/inspect_scout/llms.txt |
| **Inspect Viz** | Data visualization for Inspect log dataframes: bar charts, line and scatter plots, scorer & sample heatmaps, radar plots, with interactive filtering and tables. | https://meridianlabs-ai.github.io/inspect_viz/llms.txt |
| **Inspect SWE** | Software-engineering agent scaffolds (Claude Code, Codex CLI) usable as Inspect solvers. | https://meridianlabs-ai.github.io/inspect_swe/llms.txt |
| **Sandboxes** | Isolated environments for sample execution. Docker is built into Inspect AI for local execution. Beyond that, several external sandbox packages exist: managed cloud (e.g. Inspect Sandboxes with Daytona/Modal) and self-hosted (K8s, Proxmox, EC2, …). | [Inspect Sandboxes](https://meridianlabs-ai.github.io/inspect_sandboxes/llms.txt) · [k8s](https://k8s-sandbox.aisi.org.uk/) · [proxmox](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_proxmox_sandbox) · [ec2](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ec2_sandbox) |
| **Inspect Harbor** | Bridge to [Harbor](https://harborframework.com/) containerized agent benchmarks (e.g. Terminal Bench) as Inspect tasks. | https://meridianlabs-ai.github.io/inspect_harbor/llms.txt |

The table above is curated for the most-used packages. For the comprehensive ecosystem catalog (25+ extensions including community projects from METR, Redwood, Transluce, Vector Institute, and more), fetch [Inspect Extensions](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/extensions/index.html.md).

## Picking the right package

- *"Write/run an eval against a model"* → **Inspect AI**. First check **Inspect Evals**, the [**Inspect AI evals catalog**](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/evals/index.html.md) (cross-ecosystem index across 12 categories), and [**Inspect Harbor**'s registry](https://meridianlabs-ai.github.io/inspect_harbor/registry.html) to see if the benchmark already exists.
- *"Simple sweep across models or tasks (one-off)"* → **Inspect AI**'s `eval_set()` (built-in, supports multi-model and multi-task runs directly).
- *"Reusable / declarative orchestration: config-driven runs, post-eval workflows, or re-running the same setup later"* → **Inspect Flow** (rather than a hand-rolled Python wrapper around `eval_set()`).
- *"Identify patterns across many samples, or analyze long agent trajectories"* → **Inspect Scout**.
- *"Plot or dashboard eval results"* → **Inspect Viz**.
- *"Evaluate a coding agent"* → **Inspect SWE** for the agent, **Inspect Evals** (SWE-Bench, etc.) or **Inspect Harbor** for the benchmark.
- *"Sample needs an isolated environment"* → **Inspect AI** sandbox API. Default to the built-in Docker sandbox for development and small/test runs; reach for an external sandbox package (managed cloud or self-hosted K8s/Proxmox/EC2) for large-scale runs, resource-intensive tasks, or GPU needs.
- *"Read or inspect a single eval log or a handful of samples"* → **Inspect AI** (`inspect_ai.log` for one log; `inspect_ai.analysis` for cross-log dataframes). Use this rather than Scout when you're looking at one log or a small set.
- *"Add a custom scorer, solver, tool, or dataset"* → **Inspect AI** core.

## Before calling the API

**ALWAYS fetch and consult the relevant `llms.txt` (or docs root) before answering any question or writing any code about these packages**, even when you believe you know the API. The descriptions above are routing hints, not specs; the docs are the source of truth and change frequently. Prior-knowledge answers drift quickly and may reference renamed, moved, or removed APIs.

**Keep packages aligned with the docs.** Check the user's installed version (`pip show <package>`) against the latest on PyPI. If it's older, propose upgrading (`pip install -U <package>`) so the features in the docs are actually available at runtime. If the user can't upgrade (pinned deps, monorepo constraints), flag the version gap.

**Tip: markdown variants for agent-readable docs.** HTML versions of these docs sites are JS-rendered and may return empty content to fetch tools; use the markdown variant instead.
- `inspect.aisi.org.uk` pages: append `.html.md` (e.g. `https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/agents.html.md`).
- `ukgovernmentbeis.github.io/inspect_evals` pages: append `.llms.md` (e.g. `https://ukgovernmentbeis.github.io/inspect_evals/evals/gpqa/index.llms.md`).
